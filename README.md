# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

The demo application will present users with a list of projects, both ongoing and finished. Users with different roles will have different level of access:

Guests won’t have any access to the projects. They will only see the main page of the site.
Users will be able to see only the ongoing projects. They won’t be able to modify or delete anything.
Moderators will have access to all projects with the ability to edit the ongoing ones.
Admins will have full access.
